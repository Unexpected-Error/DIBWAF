## Textures

The textures used are mostly Quixel megascans assets, with the exception of the mud/grass floor on the 1v1 level, which I created in Quixel Mixer

## Models

Only models which aren't mine are the humanoid generic character model from Unreal Engine, and the MPX which is used in accordance with the [license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode), (model available [here](https://skfb.ly/6RBnV) ). The rest were created in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).
